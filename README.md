# Understanding and implementing different machine learning models. 


Logistic Regression is the starting level algorithm in the field of machine learning. Although implementing using both sklearn and deep learning is a really easy task. But understanding the algorithm in-depth and the maths behind it is essential in moving forward with your knowledge.


In this notebook a logistic regression model is built from scratch and implemented on Iris dataset. 


For building the model from scratch, we have built four functions. 


1. Sigmoid function

2. Cost function

3. Gradient function

4. Logistic Regression function


## Sigmoid function

The sigmoid function calculates the sigmoid value. 


## Cost function

The cost function calculates the cost which is assigned to the model. 


## Gradient function

A simple gradient method that calculates the gradient of both the weights and base values. 


## Logistic regression function

The logistic regression function updates the weights, which then calculates the cost. To update the weights, we use the gradient function, which calculates the gradient.
