# Understading and implement different machine learning models. 

Logestic Regression is the starting level algorithim in the field of machine learning. Although implementing using both sklearn and deep learning is a really easy task. But understanding the algorithm in depth and the maths behind it is essential in moving forward with your knowledege.

In this notebook a logestic regression model is built from scratch and implemented on Iris dataset. 

For builting the model from scratch we have built four functions. 

1. Sigmoid function
2. Cost function
3. Gradient function
4. Logestic Regression function

## Sigmoid function
The sigmoid function calculates the sigmoid value. 

## Cost function
The cost function calculates the cost which is assign to the model. 

## Gradient function
A simple gradient method which calculates the gradient of both the weights and base values. 

## Logestic regression function
The logestic regression function is used to update the weights which then calculates the cost. To update the weights we use gradient function which calculates the gradient.
